# 2015.11.10 Verification Flight1 for Waypoint Sequence Planner

On 2015.11.10 at around 11:30 AM, Sharon and I launched the Phoenix (tail pusher) small
fixed-wing aircraft. The goal was to conduct a test flight, using the optimal tour
sequence generated with the path planner.

We did about 3 tours through the points before the plane crashed. Sharon said he's had
problems with the battery dying on the Phoenix. The best tour (closest to the
planned) path length should be calculated for comparison.

Looking at the data, it appears the strong South by Southwestarly wind may have
prevented the plane from reaching point 3 and especially point 4. However, Sharon
informed me that he does not have a radius of acceptance feature enabled. So
this may be due to GPS measruement error. The error is within the 10-20 m range
from waypoints 3 and 4.

The minimum distance to each waypoint for each tour track should be calculated
and compared as a measure of error.

## Scenario Data

The origin is:

    [36.988505,-122.0509133,0]

The points (local coordinates recorded in 2015.11.07_east4wp_local.csv) are:

    14.1924, 91.5624
    -23.7207, 171.914
    -216.686, 189.736
    -236.224, 47.4646

With the start heading at 0 rad (North), and initial position:

    0, 0

The headings should be computed (never saved) with the path planner for generating
expected Dubins paths for comparison.
